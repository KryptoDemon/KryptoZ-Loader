To Install Any Updates, Join the discord. There is a button in the Application.

If You Get Any Errors / Bugs At All, Check my Discord Server, there is a Section for this.

To Add Scripts To The Script List, Just Put '.txt' & '.lua' Files Into The Folder Named "scripts".

If it says "krnl is outdated", this is because ROBLOX has updated. You may have to wait for a few days for it to update.
